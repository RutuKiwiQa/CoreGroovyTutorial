## What is Groovy?

###### Apache Groovy is a Java-syntax-compatible object-oriented programming language for the Java platform. It is both a static and dynamic language with features similar to those of Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk. It can be used as both a programming language and a scripting language for the Java Platform, is compiled to Java virtual machine (JVM) bytecode, and interoperates seamlessly with other Java code and libraries. Groovy uses a curly-bracket syntax similar to Java's. Groovy supports closures, multiline strings, and expressions embedded in strings. Much of Groovy's power lies in its AST transformations, triggered through annotations.

###### Groovy source code gets compiled into Java Bytecode so it can run on any platform that has JRE is installed. Groovy also performs a lot of tasks behind the scene that makes it more agile and dynamic.

###### Groovy can be used as a scripting language for the Java platform. It is almost like a super version of Java which offers Java's enterprise capabilities. It also offers many productivity features like DSL support, closures, and dynamic typing. Unlike some other languages, it is designed as a companion, not a replacement for Java.

## Why Groovy ?
Here are major reasons, why we should use groovy
 ###### Groovy is agile and dynamic language.
 ###### Groovy syntax is simple and easy. It saves a lot of code and effort thus increasing the productivity of developer if he had to do the same thing in Java.
 ###### In groovy semicolon and braces are not mandatory, i.e we can even run a groovy program without semicolon.
 ###### We can easily create both groovy script and groovy class.
 ###### Easy to understand as it is similar to java
 ###### In groovy class and functions are not necessary, you can simply run your groovy script by writing your code using groovy script
  
## Download and Install Link
  ###### Ensure sure you have java installed in your system, you can easily check java version in cmd using command 
   ######  	Java -version
	
 ###### Go to http://groovy-lang.org/download.html
 ###### Select windows installer and install groovy also download entire groovy package which will be useful for configuring groovy in ide.


 ######  After Installing groovy you can use any IDE as per your preference, eclipse or intelije, here I am using intellije IDE, therefore adding link for how to configure groovy in intellije https://www.logicbig.com/tutorials/misc/groovy/intellij.html
 
 ## About Project
 ###### This project is further subdivided into three folders.
 ######  Basic Documentation :- which has one simple basic groovy documentation
 ######  Files : - text files which are created by me, while performing file input output programs in groovy.
 ######  src : - This folder contains actual groovy programs,that are splitten into folders namely com/groovy/abstract Demo, com/groovy/Basic Groovy , com/groovy/Interface Demo and com/groovy/ObjectOrientedPrograms.
 ###### Abstract Demo contains groovy script example of how to perform abstract class.
 ###### Basic Groovy has groovy script examples for operators, variables, datatypes, control structures ( i.e DecisionMaking - if,if -else, switch and Looping(while,for, and for in), lists, ranges, regular expressions, methods, closures, Exception Handling , File IO,Maps,FirstGroovyProgram and String
 ###### Interface Demo has example of how to use interface in groovy.
 ###### ObjectOrientedPrograms has examples of Class and object using same class and different class as well as inheritance in groovy
