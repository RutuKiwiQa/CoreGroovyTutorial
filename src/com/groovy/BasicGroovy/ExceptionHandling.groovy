//Finally Block
/**
 * The finally block follows a try block or a catch block.
 * A finally block of code always executes, irrespective of occurrence of an Exception.
 *
 * Using a finally block allows you to run any cleanup-type statements that you want to execute,
 * no matter what happens in the protected code. The syntax for this block is given below.
